And one for [Limes](https://limealicious.carrd.co/), the Ferret VTuber, for sending me on this hell hole of a ride. Did she actually send me? lol no I just happened to watch a [YouTube Short](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/zKnsMPDuYNA) after a long day at work (super tired) and going "you know what... we ball"
